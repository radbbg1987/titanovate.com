    <p class="small" style="max-width:820px">
      Titanovate Tech was founded to bridge the gap between quantitative rigor and qualitative market judgment.
      We believe durable performance comes from combining systematic models with experienced human oversight.

        <h3>Quantitative Foundations</h3>
        <p>
          Our team builds and maintains systematic models across risk, volatility, momentum,
          relative value, and cross-asset behaviour. These models are designed to be robust,
          explainable, and grounded in real market microstructure.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Qualitative Judgment</h3>
        <p>
          Alongside quantitative research, we apply qualitative assessment informed by market
          experience — regime awareness, structural shifts, liquidity conditions, and macro context
          that pure models often miss.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Team-Tested Approach</h3>
        <p>
          All frameworks and tools are developed, reviewed, and tested internally by the team
          before being exposed to users. Our focus is on repeatability, risk discipline, and
          operational realism.
        </p>

        <h3>Technology as an Enabler</h3>
        <p>
          Titanovate is built as a technology platform — enabling structured decision-making,
          consistent execution, and transparent risk monitoring — rather than as a black-box
          or signal-selling product.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Global Market Perspective</h3>
        <p>
          Our work spans multiple asset classes and regions, allowing us to study correlations,
          dispersion, and regime interactions across global markets rather than in isolation.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Long-Term Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          Titanovate was created with a long-term institutional mindset: prioritising capital
          preservation, measured risk-taking, and sustainable performance over short-term
          optimisation or marketing-driven claims.
